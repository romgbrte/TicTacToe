# TicTacToe
## What is this?
This project is the product of a group-focused college course from 2014 wherein each group was to design and build a tic-tac-toe game for use in a last-game-standing tournament between the groups.

Certain specifications were to be met such as using a 5x5 grid for the board as opposed to the traditional 3x3 grid, the ablility for two humans to play against one another, to implement an A.I. opponent (or three in our case), and to provde a record-keeping system for user profiles and win/loss/draw tracking.

## How to play
To begin, you may either create a new user name, select a stored user, or remain anonymous as a guest.

Next, choose whether your opponent will be another player or an A.I. - and if so, which difficulty level.

Finally, decide who will make the first move and click Play! to begin the game.

The first player to get four of their pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is the winner.

## Controls
- **[Left mouse]** (in menus): activate UI elements
- **[Left mouse]** (in game, player's turn): place your piece in an empty space under your mouse cursor
- **[Left mouse]** (in game, A.I.'s turn): click anywhere to have the A.I. opponent take their turn
